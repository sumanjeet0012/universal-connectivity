"""Framework-independent application events.

Design goals (Phase 2 brief §6.5):
- One event model shared by every adapter.
- Subscribers can subscribe/unsubscribe safely from any thread.
- Publishing never blocks the trio/libp2p thread: queues are bounded and a full
  queue drops the oldest event for that subscriber.
- Consumers may live on a different event loop (Tornado/asyncio) than the
  producer (trio), so each subscription uses a ``janus`` queue.
